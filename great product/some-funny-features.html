Like her debut album, it was produced by Blake Mevis.</p><p>Her second and final album for the label, it produced two minor chart hits on both the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and the Canadian RPM Top Country Tracks charts. The first, "Closer to Heaven", was a #31 in the US and #45 in Canada, while "The Strong One" was a #57 in the US and a #30 in Canada. The third single, "This Heart", failed to chart in either country, and by the end of 1998, Mason had exited Atlantic. "Let Me Cry" was co-written by Buffy Lawson, who founded the country duo Bomshel in 2004.</p></section></div></div></div></body>
