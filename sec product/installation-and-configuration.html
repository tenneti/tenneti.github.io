In this lesson, we’re going to look at what suspended chords are, how they’re used, and how to play them.</p><p>This is the third lesson in the series of lessons on chords. In the first lesson, we looked at open chords, as well as a bit of theory relating to what chords are and how they are constructed. In the second lesson, we explored bar chords.</p><p>In this lesson we’re going to look at suspended’ chords, or Sus chords, for short.</p><p>Sus chords are (mostly) Major chords that have an extra note of the scale ‘suspended’ in the chord. There are two main types of Suspended chords: Sus 2 and Sus 4</p><p>We’re going to look at how to play these chords shortly. If you’re not interested in the theory that gets us there, simply scroll down and observe the chord diagrams. If you’re interested in knowing about the theory, read on.</p><p>Let’s start with the Sus 4 chord. As mentioned before, Sus is short for suspended. When we say Sus 4, we actually mean Suspended 4, which means that the 4th note of the scale is suspended in the chord.</p></section></div></div></div></body>
